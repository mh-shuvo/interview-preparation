# Task Scheduling & Jobs
task scheduling and jobs in Laravel provide powerful tools for automating tasks and performing background processing.

- `Task scheduling` is used for running recurring tasks, 
- while `jobs` handle asynchronous background processing. 
- `Commands` and the console play a role in defining and managing these tasks and jobs.
